# Database_Project_B_tree
The goal of this project is to implement a B+ tree model that processes number inserting and deleting.

The visualization of number inserting and deletion in B+ tree can be seen in this link. https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BPlusTree.html

My B+ tree model is implemented in bptree.py

It takes input testcases from 'input' file and saves the corresponding B+ tree at 'output' file in text form.
